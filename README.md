# printf()
In this repo we recreate the printf() function.

# Motivation
This is our first partner project for Holberton School - and our first time experiencing pair programming.  Over the last two months we have been learning C basics. In this repo we bring everything we have learned together and recreate the printf() function.

# How to Use?
_printf();<br/>
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:<br/>
<br/>
###### -i, -d:
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.<br/>
###### -c:
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.<br/>
###### -s:
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).<br/>
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').<br/>
<br/>
##### Example:
_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");<br/>
##### Result:
String:[I am a string !]
